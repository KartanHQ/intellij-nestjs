# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each branch to the **develop** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate branches and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows reviewing and pulling in new features or improvements individually.
